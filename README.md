where a css file is linked within the i.e style.css file in repository
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="--paste the ulr of css file located on ur desktop---">
In style.css file in #showcase -- there is a .jpg file , so download the coral-reef.jpg file in the reposiroty or any other image from web and past the url in that block for background-image:url(-----.jpg);
